## Introduction

Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world. It is one of the largest music streaming service providers, with over 615 million monthly active users, including 239 million paying subscribers, as of March 2024. Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded audio content, including more than 100 million songs and six million podcast titles, from record labels and media companies. As a freemium service, basic features are free with advertisements and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions. Users can search for music based on artist, album, or genre, and can create, edit, and share playlists.

### Market Analysis
Spotify operates on a freemium business model, offering both a free ad-supported tier and a paid subscription without ads. This model has fueled rapid user growth â€” Spotify has added over 400 million users in just the last 5 years. However, converting those users to paying subscribers has been a greater challenge.
Over the past year, Spotify has focused heavily on improving profitability. In addition to subscription price hikes rolled out globally, Spotify has laid off 6% of its workforce and scaled back spending on podcast content and marketing. These actions led adjusted operating income to reach â‚¬32 million in Q3, a remarkable turnaround from the â‚¬228 million loss in the year-ago quarter.

Improving profitability is crucial for Spotify to reassure investors. Since going public in 2018 at a $30 billion valuation, Spotify has yet to deliver consistent profits, leading its stock price to underperform the broader market. With slowing revenue growth and thin margins, Spotify remains in a precarious financial position unless it can sustain the cost-cutting measures that fueled its recent profitability.
